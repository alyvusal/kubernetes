# Cluster Autoscaler

[back](../README.md)

Check [EKS addons](../../../eks/addons/terraform/) also for deployments

Kubernetes offers the following autoscalers:

1. Cluster Autoscaler (CA): Autoscales nodes based on the required resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to run scheduled pods. At Pingpong, we use arpenter as an alternative to CA.
2. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Adjusts the number of pod replicas based on traffic. Each pod requires the same amount of resources.
3. Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA): Adjusts the resource requests and limits of individual pods based on traffic. VPA requires pod restarts when changing resources, and there are limitations to the resources (CPU, memory) that a single node can hold.

## Combining Autoscalers for Optimal Performance

In practice, HPA, VPA, and Cluster Autoscaler are often used in tandem to achieve both efficient resource utilization and responsive scaling. However, itâ€™s crucial to understand their interactions:

1. HPA and VPA: Should be used with caution together as **they can conflict**; for example, HPA might try to add more pods when VPA recommends increasing resources to existing pods.
2. HPA and Cluster Autoscaler: Complement each other well, as HPA adjusts the number of pods and Cluster Autoscaler adjusts the number of nodes to accommodate the pods.
3. VPA and Cluster Autoscaler: Can be used together to ensure pods have enough resources and that nodes are added or removed based on overall demand.

## Deploy with KOWK for local test

To be able to use scaling of nodes on laptop we need to use [KWOK](../../kwok/README.md). We will use [KWOK provider](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/kwok) in autoscaling
